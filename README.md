Python EnergyPlus Weather File (EPW) Generator


**This is a work in progress, do NOT expect it to actually work!**

The aim of this project is to generate EPW files with Python. The necessary data structures are generated by parsing a modified EPW idd file from the document Auxiliary EnergyPlus Programs - Extra programs for EnergyPlus, Date: November 22, 2013. 

The script to parse the IDD definitions and generate the epw.py file is in the generator package. In practice only the epw.py need to be used.
